# Words of Attraction
Claire Koval and Danny Kim

A magnetic poetry app created in Swift for IGME-340 Spring

## Proposed Features
1. Add custom words
2. Deleting words with animated trash can icon that gets bigger as word gets closer to the icon
3. Shake or press button to clear screen and move words back to the top.

## Checkpoint 1
### Initial Sketches

Word would ideally be positioned at the bottom so that the user feels gets the feeling of texting. There will be an export button at the top to save to gallery, save to app, or export/share on other apps

User interaction with the pan gesture draggability is working, and the words start off at the top of the screen. It works on iPhone and iPad.
